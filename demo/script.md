# NEXUS Demo Script: The 3-Minute Deep Dive

## Phase 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
- **Visual:** Show the empty NEXUS HUD.
- **Narration:** "This is NEXUS. In a world of infinite data, the bottleneck is synthesis. We built a research substrate that doesn't just answer questions—it coordinates a team of specialized agents to solve them."

## Phase 2: Context Ingestion (0:30 - 1:00)
- **Action:** Click "Import Demo Data". Watch the logs stream.
- **Narration:** "We're mounting a 'Context Vault'—incident logs, CSV metrics, and post-mortems. NEXUS doesn't just read these; it indexes them into a local-first memory layer, ensuring every insight is grounded in your specific data."

## Phase 3: The Multi-Agent Loop (1:00 - 2:00)
- **Action:** Type: *"Explain the primary cause of the latency regression in March using the CSV and post-mortem notes."*
- **Visual:** Focus on the Agent Substrate grid. Watch Lit Agent, Critic, and Scribe activate in sequence.
- **Narration:** "Notice the orchestration. First, the Literature Agent scans the vault. Then, the Critic finds the contradiction between the changelog and the latency spikes. Finally, the Scribe synthesizes the finding."

## Phase 4: Data Visualization (2:00 - 2:30)
- **Visual:** Scroll to the generated Chart.
- **Narration:** "NEXUS automatically detected the CSV artifact and rendered a live visualization. We're looking at the exact moment the thinking budget was increased, correlating directly with the latency spike."

## Phase 5: Closing (2:30 - 3:00)
- **Action:** Show the "Research Card" generated.
- **Narration:** "The result is a decision-ready artifact. Verified, grounded, and stored in the vault. This is the future of collaborative research with Gemini 3. This is NEXUS."
